# AudioLines

AudioLines is a mobile App for recording several tracks and create own little songs in a fast and simple way. See it as a sketchpad - for music!

# Features

  - BPM function
  - Tracks can be muted and unmuted to your liking
  - One or several tracks can be exported

### Tech

AudioLines uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ionic] -  Open-source SDK for hybrid mobile app development
* [Cordova] - build applications for mobile devices using CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework
* [Materialize] - modern responsive front-end framework based on Material Design
* [jQuery]

### Installation

AudioLines requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

Install the dependencies.

```sh
$ cd audiolines
$ npm install
```

Afterwards build the project...

```sh
$ ionic cordova run android
```

or

```sh
$ ionic cordova run ios
```
To test the app directly on your phone, make sure it is plugged in while building (and USB debugging is activated). It should be automatically recognized. Of course, AndroidStudio can be used instead of the CLI.
